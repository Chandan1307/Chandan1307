#👋 Hi there, I'm Chandan Choudhary!
## 🚀 About Me

I am a professional with 3 years of experience in software testing, supporting requirement gathering, client communication, and functional validation for web applications. Aspiring Business Analyst role. Experienced in translating business requirements into clear scenarios and acceptance criteria, identifying requirement gaps, and ensuring alignment between business and technical teams. Hands-on exposure to requirement documentation, SQL-based data validation, Excel reporting, and supporting UAT activities, with a strong analytical and problem-solving mindset.

Through hands-on experience, I have worked closely with requirements analysis, workflow understanding, and business rule validation, which naturally led me toward the analytical and functional aspects of product development.

I thrive at the intersection of business and technology—translating complex requirements into actionable insights, clear documentation, and reliable solutions.

What I bring to the table:
- Requirement analysis and conversion into clear test scenarios and user stories
- API analysis, backend validation, and SQL-based data verification
- Client communication, status reporting, and risk/issue management
- Communicating with clients, gathering updates, and reporting risks/issues
- Cross-functional collaboration with developers, QA teams, and stakeholders
  
In my current role, I work directly with Indian clients to gather requirements, clarify business workflows, monitor production issues using Sentry, raise and track tickets, and coordinate with developers to ensure timely resolution and accurate delivery.
