# 👋 Hi there, I'm Chandan Choudhary!

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate **Business Analyst, Strategy** with expertise in data analysis, visualization, cloud technologies (AWS), and automation.  
Strong background in software testing, bug fixing, and delivering high-quality data-driven solutions.
Business Analysis with 2.8 years of experience in Client handling, testing, automation, API validation, and data-driven analysis.

With a strong background in understanding requirements, breaking down workflows, and validating business rules, I naturally developed an interest in the analytical and functional side of product development.

What I bring to the table:
• Requirement understanding & converting them into clear test scenarios
• API analysis, backend validation, and SQL-based data checks
• Writing Python-based automation scripts using Playwright
• Communicating with clients, gathering updates, and reporting risks/issues
• Cross-functional collaboration with developers, QA teams, and stakeholders

Over time, I realized that my strengths align deeply with problem-solving, requirement analysis, user-story detailing, and improving product functionality, which encouraged me to move toward Business Analyst roles.
