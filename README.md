#👋 Hi there, I'm Chandan Choudhary!
## 🚀 About Me

I am a passionate Business Analyst (Strategy-focused) with 2.8 years of experience in client handling, testing, automation, API validation, and data-driven analysis. I bring a strong analytical mindset combined with hands-on technical expertise to deliver high-quality, business-aligned solutions.

My background includes data analysis and visualization, cloud technologies (AWS), backend validation, and automation. Through extensive experience in requirement understanding, workflow breakdown, and business rule validation, I developed a strong interest in the analytical and functional aspects of product development.

I thrive at the intersection of business and technology—translating complex requirements into actionable insights, clear documentation, and reliable solutions.

What I bring to the table:
• Requirement analysis and conversion into clear test scenarios and user stories
• API analysis, backend validation, and SQL-based data verification
• Client communication, status reporting, and risk/issue management
• Communicating with clients, gathering updates, and reporting risks/issues
• Cross-functional collaboration with developers, QA teams, and stakeholders

Over time, I recognized that my strengths lie in problem-solving, requirement analysis, user story detailing, and improving product functionality. This realization reinforced my transition toward Business Analyst roles focused on strategy and impact.
