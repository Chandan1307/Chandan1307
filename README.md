#👋 Hi there, I'm Chandan Choudhary!
## 🚀 About Me

I am a professional with 2.8 years of experience in software testing and client-facing roles, currently transitioning into an Entry-Level Business Analyst role. My background in testing, automation, API validation, and data analysis has given me a strong foundation in understanding business requirements and validating functional outcomes.

Through hands-on experience, I have worked closely with requirements analysis, workflow understanding, and business rule validation, which naturally led me toward the analytical and functional aspects of product development.

I thrive at the intersection of business and technology—translating complex requirements into actionable insights, clear documentation, and reliable solutions.

What I bring to the table:
- Requirement analysis and conversion into clear test scenarios and user stories
- API analysis, backend validation, and SQL-based data verification
- Client communication, status reporting, and risk/issue management
- Communicating with clients, gathering updates, and reporting risks/issues
- Cross-functional collaboration with developers, QA teams, and stakeholders
  
  Over time, I recognized that my strengths lie in problem-solving, requirement analysis, user story detailing, and improving product functionality. This realization reinforced my transition toward Business         Analyst roles focused on strategy and impact.
